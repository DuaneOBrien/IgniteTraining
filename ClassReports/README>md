# Class Reports

## Why You Should Do Them

There are several compelling reasons to complete a class report after teaching a class:

* It's a great way to remember what to tweak for the next class;
* Sharing the reports makes it easy to collaborate with fellow instructors;
* It provides an artifact trail for the evolution of your program;
* You can use the data to report up to management;

Even if you're only running one class, filling out a report will give you a starting point should you or anyone else want to run a class later.

## How To Do Them

Class time is divided into Instructional Time, Independent Work and Paired Iterations. Take advantage of the Independent Work sessions to jot down some notes on what is working, what isn't working, and what would make the next class better.

After the class has concluded and the Ignite talks have been completed, take 15 minutes to complete and commit the Class Report. A couple of sentences in each section should be sufficient. Be sensitive to the data you are sharing in the reports, especially if you are committing into a public repository.

## Survey

You can learn a lot by providing a way for students to give you anonymous feedback. One effective method of doing this is by using a survey to collect a [Net Promotor Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) or NPS. The service [Survey Monkey](https://surveymonkey.com/) is great for this, and provides a template. [Here is an example](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/BFRL2R6) of an NPS survey.

Email a survey link to your students right after the class concludes, before you start filling out your class report. The sooner your students get the opportunity to provide feedback, the more relevant the feedback will be and the more likely they will be to respond. Update the class report as results come in. It is normal to have some students who don't give feedback, but it may take a couple days for your last couple responses to come in.
